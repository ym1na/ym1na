# 🦕 Hi, I'm Yasmin! 🦕
I'm a junior at the University of Illinois Chicago studying Computer Science🧑‍💻💻. I'm interested in exploring the worlds of software engineering, product management, ML Engineering, and all things innovation.

I enjoy going through the full development process (including architecture and modeling👀).

- 📱 I’m currently working on a Swift app with [@LeafProject](https://github.com/Leaf-Project-2024), learning more about firebase and mobile development (p.s. Also React Native app dev)
- 📰 I'm also working on a Technology News Insight Engine w/Accenture (AI project hehehe😌)
- 🏢 Previous SWE intern @ JPMC, Charles Schwab, and PEAK6
- 💬 Data visualization is cool!!

## 🖥️ ym1na Code Samples
Here’s a sneak peek at some of my daily actions:
```python
# Sleeping Code💤
def mimir():
    return "MIMIMIMIMI 🛏️"

print(mimir())
```
```python
# Eating Code 🍴
def chomp():
    return "🦖🍽️"

print(chomp())
```
```python
# Not adding projects to github Code 🫠
def local():
    return "Still local....🙃"

print(local())
```
